## Overview
This IPL (Indian Premier League) Win Predictor is a Python application that uses machine learning to predict the outcome of an IPL match based on various match parameters. It provides the probability of winning for the batting team and the bowling team.

## Features
- Predicts the probability of winning for the batting and bowling teams.
- Takes into account factors like target score, runs scored, overs bowled, wickets taken, and more.
- Allows users to input match-specific details, including batting team, bowling team, host city, target score, runs scored, overs bowled, and wickets taken.
- Utilizes a scikit-learn machine learning pipeline with logistic regression.
- Displays results with a user-friendly Streamlit web interface.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`.
